# 🥔 Potato Doc App  

**Potato Doc** is an advanced deep learning application that classifies **potato diseases** using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. The app detects:  

✅ **Healthy potato leaves**  
⚠️ **Early blight** (caused by fungus)  
⚠️ **Late blight** (caused by a microorganism)  

By providing **early disease detection**, **Potato Doc** helps **farmers take timely action**, reducing crop loss and improving yield.
